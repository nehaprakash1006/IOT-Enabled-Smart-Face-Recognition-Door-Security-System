### üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Face Recognition Script (Python)

1. Clone/download this repository
2. Create a folder named `known_faces/` and add images of known people  
   *(e.g., `john.jpg`, `alice.png`)*
3. Edit the following variables in `main.py`:
   - `ARDUINO_PORT` (e.g., `'COM8'`)
   - `YOUR_EMAIL`, `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD`
   - `OWNER_EMAIL` (email to receive alerts)
   - `BLYNK_TOKEN` (from Blynk dashboard)

4. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
