## üîå Step-by-Step Wiring with Breadboard Numbers

### 1. ‚úÖ Connect Arduino Power to Breadboard

| Arduino Pin | Breadboard        | Notes                         |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| 5V          | Red rail (top)    | Power rail, use jumper wire  |
| GND         | Blue rail (top)   | Ground rail, jumper wire     |

üí° These rails now provide power to all your components.

| Long (Anode)    | E14            | D8          | Jumper from E14 to D8         |
| Short (Cathode) | E15            | ‚Äî           | Jumper to blue (GND) rail     |

---

### 5. üîä BUZZER

| Buzzer Pin | Breadboard Row | Arduino Pin | Notes                         |
|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| + (long)   | E18            | D9          | Jumper from E18 to D9         |
| ‚Äì (short)  | E19            | ‚Äî           | Jumper to blue (GND) rail     |


Install dependencies:

pip install opencv-python face_recognition yagmail requests

### üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Face Recognition Script (Python)

1. Clone/download this repository
2. Create a folder named `known_faces/` and add images of known people  
   *(e.g., `john.jpg`, `alice.png`)*
3. Edit the following variables in `main.py`:
   - `ARDUINO_PORT` (e.g., `'COM8'`)
   - `YOUR_EMAIL`, `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD`
   - `OWNER_EMAIL` (email to receive alerts)
   - `BLYNK_TOKEN` (from Blynk dashboard)

4. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
